### useState Hook
The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application. Access the <a href="https://github.com/Barbarpotato/React-Hook-Fundamental/tree/useState">useState</a> Branch to learn more.

### useEffect Hook
useEffect is a hook for encapsulating code that has 'side effects,' and is like a combination of componentDidMount , componentDidUpdate , and componentWillUnmount . Previously, functional components didn't have access to the component life cycle, but with useEffect you can tap into it.

### useReducer Hook
<a href="https://github.com/Barbarpotato/React-Hook-Fundamental/tree/useReducer">useReducer</a> is a React Hook that provides a way to manage state and perform state transitions in a React function component. It is similar to the redux library in that it allows you to centralize and manage the state of your application in a single location.
